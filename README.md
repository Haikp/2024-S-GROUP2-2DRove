# Augment System Branch

## Overview
Welcome to the Augment System Branch of our 2D Roguelike Video Game Project! This branch focuses on implementing and refining an augment system that enhances player abilities and progression within the Unity engine.

## Core Components
### Augment Drops
In this branch, we are dedicated to implementing augment drops that players can collect throughout the game. These drops will provide various buffs, unlock new spells, and strengthen player characters, offering a sense of progression and empowerment.

### Augment Management
The augment system will include mechanics for managing acquired augments, such as inventory management and equipping augments to characters. Players will have the ability to strategically choose which augments to use based on their playstyle and current objectives.

### Augment Effects
Each augment will offer unique effects and enhancements to player abilities. From increasing damage output to providing defensive bonuses or granting new abilities, augments will play a crucial role in shaping the player's gameplay experience.
